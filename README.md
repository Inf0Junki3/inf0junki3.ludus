# Ansible Collection - inf0junki3.ludus

Wrote this collection for my ludus range, to set up some of the tools I use during simulations / lab work. Please feel
free to use these outside of a ludus range, of course - but do note that because I developed these for a range, I don't
always harden them for external perimeters. As such, you should definitely take some time to harden these.

If you have any improvement suggestions, please feel free to create a PR on my repo. And while I do appreciate - even
welcome - constructive criticism, I will only address issues that I have the bandwidth and motivation for, in
best-effort mode.

For an overview on how to use, kindly consult the very excellent [ludus
documentation](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/roles).
